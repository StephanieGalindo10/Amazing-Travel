                                  <p>My work explores the relationship between the tyranny of ageing and multimedia experiences. With influences as diverse as Wittgenstein and Joni Mitchell, new combinations are crafted from both mundane and transcendant dialogues.

                                    Ever since I was a child I have been fascinated by the ephemeral nature of the zeitgeist. What starts out as vision soon becomes debased into a manifesto of futility, leaving only a sense of decadence and the prospect of a new beginning.
                                    
                                    As intermittent forms become frozen through studious and academic practice, the viewer is left with a hymn to the limits of our future.</p>

<h3 class="title">Ways of Traveling</h3>
<p>
  A huge part of photography is about sharing your work. Whether you are selling your art or just putting the image on the web people will get to see it. You can seek critiques or even have gallery parties to show your work. Face it, if your images are stuck on your hard drive, what is the point?  Sharing your images with the right photographers will help you improve, get business and help you challenge yourself to take better photos. It will also give you something to talk about
  Sometimes it’s only far from home that you realize you you’ve got skills you’ve never used. It’s travel that brings them to the surface and makes you smile, satisfied to have reached the mountain top, or  crossed a gorge  or helped a villager clean up after a storm, or even to have successfully ordered a meal at a rural Chinese restaurant.
